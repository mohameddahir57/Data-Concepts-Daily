# **Day 16 → Data Quality (Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency)**

Good decisions depend on **good data**.
Bad decisions come from **bad data**.

This is why **Data Quality** is one of the most important topics in the data world.
Even the most advanced analysis, dashboards, or machine learning models will fail if the data is low quality.

Let’s break this down in a simple and clear way.

##  **What Is Data Quality?**

Data Quality means **how good, reliable, and trustworthy the data is**.

High-quality data helps companies:

 Make accurate decisions
 Avoid mistakes
 Understand customers
 Build better products
 Improve performance

Low-quality data causes confusion, wrong analysis, and money loss.



##  The 3 Core Dimensions of Data Quality

There are many data quality dimensions, but the three most important ones are:

1️.**Accuracy**
2️.**Completeness**
3️.**Consistency**

Let’s explain them simply.



##  1. Accuracy → Is the data correct?

Accuracy means the data reflects **the truth**.

Examples of accurate vs inaccurate data:

| Scenario      | Accurate    | Inaccurate       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Customer age  | 25          | 250              |
| Product price | $19.99      | $1999 by mistake |
| Phone number  | Real number | Wrong digits     |

Inaccurate data leads to wrong analysis.



##  2. Completeness → Is anything missing?

Completeness means **all important values are present**.

Examples:

* Missing customer phone numbers
* Missing product names
* Missing dates in sales data
* Missing email addresses

Incomplete data makes analysis weak because you don’t have the full picture.



##  3. Consistency → Does the data match across all systems?

Consistency means the data is the **same everywhere**.

Examples:

* In one system: Customer name = “Mohamed Osman”
* In another system: “Mohamed O.”

Or:

* App shows product price = $20
* Database shows price = $25

This creates confusion and destroys trust.



##  Real-Life Example of Bad Data Quality

Imagine a company sending emails to customers.
If data is wrong:

* Names spelled incorrectly
* Emails missing
* Duplicate entries
* Inconsistent records

The emails might fail, and the company loses money and trust.



## 🛠 How Data Analysts Improve Data Quality

Data analysts use tools and techniques to ensure data is clean and reliable.

###  1. Data Validation

Check if data looks correct (e.g., no negative ages).

###  2. Removing Duplicates

Make sure each record appears only once.

###  3. Filling Missing Values

Use techniques like:

* Mean/median replacement
* Using default values
* Removing rows if necessary

###  4. Standardization

Same format across all data:

* Dates
* Names
* Phone numbers
* Currency

###  5. Automated checks

Rules that alert teams when data has problems.



##  Real Company Examples

### **Airlines**

Wrong passenger data = boarding problems + delays.

### **Banks**

Inconsistent balances across systems = financial risk.

### **E-commerce**

Wrong inventory data = selling out-of-stock products.

Data quality = business quality.



##  Why Data Quality Matters

Good data quality means:

* More trust in dashboards
* Better business decisions
* Stronger models and predictions
* Fewer mistakes
* Happier customers
* Better company performance

As a future data analyst, understanding data quality makes you more valuable.



##  Summary

| Dimension    | Meaning              | Example Issue               |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Accuracy     | Data is correct      | Wrong prices                |
| Completeness | Data is not missing  | Empty fields                |
| Consistency  | Same data everywhere | Different values in systems |

Data quality is the foundation of all analytics — without it, nothing else works.
