# Day 2 — Types of Data 

Understanding data types is one of the most important foundations in the data world.
Every dataset you will work with — in Excel, SQL, Python, or dashboards — is built from these types.

Today we focus on **the four major types of data** used in analytics.

## 1. Qualitative Data (Categorical)

This is **non-numerical** data. It describes *qualities*, *labels*, or *categories*.

**Examples:**

* Gender: *Male, Female*
* Country: *Kenya, Somalia, Japan*
* Color: *Red, Blue, Yellow*
* Customer feedback: *“Good”, “Bad”, “Excellent”*

**Use case:**
Helps us group people or items into categories.



## 2. Quantitative Data (Numerical)

This is **number-based** data. Anything you can count or measure.

**Examples:**

* Salary
* Age
* Distance
* Temperature
* Number of sales

**Use case:**
Used for calculations, averages, trends, charts, and statistics.



## 3. Discrete Data

A type of numerical data that can only be **whole numbers**.
You **cannot have decimals**.

**Examples:**

* Number of students in a class
* Number of goals scored
* Number of products sold

**Use case:**
Counting things.



## 4. Continuous Data

Numerical data that **can have decimals** and can be measured in finer detail.

**Examples:**

* Height
* Weight
* Time
* Speed
* Temperature

**Use case:**
Measurements that can go to decimal values.



## Why This Matters for Data Analysts

Knowing data types helps you:

* Choose the correct chart
* Clean data properly
* Select correct statistical methods
* Decide how to store data in Excel, SQL, or Python
* Prevent errors when analyzing datasets

It is one of the first things analysts check before starting any project.



## Summary Table

| Data Type    | Meaning                | Example                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Qualitative  | Descriptive categories | Eye color, country, brand |
| Quantitative | Number-based           | Salary, distance, score   |
| Discrete     | Whole numbers only     | Number of orders          |
| Continuous   | Numbers with decimals  | Time, speed, height       |
