## 🔹 **What Is Data? (Simple Explanation)**

Data is **information**.
It can be anything that can be **recorded, stored, or used**.

Examples:

* Your age → *data*
* The temperature today → *data*
* A photo on your phone → *data*
* A YouTube video → *data*
* The number of steps you walked → *data*

If you can save it, count it, or analyze it, it is **data**.

## 🔹 **Where Do We See Data in Real Life?**

Data appears in almost everything we do:

* At the supermarket → product prices, sales numbers
* On TikTok → your likes, watch time
* In football → goals, shots, passes, player speed
* On Google Maps → distance, traffic, your location
* In school → marks, attendance

Every company collects data because it helps them make decisions.

## 🔹 **Why Is Data Important?**

Data helps answer questions like:

* Which product sells the most?
* Why did sales go down this month?
* What video should TikTok show you next?
* Which football player performs better?
* Which road has less traffic?

Companies use data to:

## 🔹 **How Do Data Analysts Use Data?**

A data analyst’s job is to:

1. **Collect** data

3. **Analyze** data
4. **Find patterns**
5. **Explain results**

They help businesses make smart decisions using numbers and facts.

## 🔹 **Simple Example (Daily Life)**

You want to know how much money you spend every month.
If you write down:

* Transportation: $35
* Food: $160
* Phone bill: $15
* Clothes: $40

You are already **collecting data**.
If you add the numbers to find the total, you are **analyzing data**.

This is exactly what data analysts do — but with bigger datasets.
