# **Day 34 → Case Study: Sales Data Analysis (SQL + Insights)**

This case study shows **how a data analyst thinks and works** using a real-world sales dataset.
We will go step by step — from understanding the business problem to writing SQL queries and generating insights.

This is exactly the type of work data analysts do in companies.

##  Business Scenario

Imagine you are a **Data Analyst** working for a retail company that sells products across different regions.

Management asks you:

> “We have sales data, but we don’t clearly understand our performance.
> Can you analyze our sales and give us insights to improve revenue?”

You are given a **sales database** and asked to analyze it using **SQL**.

## 🧮 Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue

Revenue formula:

```
Revenue = quantity × price
```

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales;
```

### 🔍 Insight:

* This tells management how much money the business made in total.
* This is often the **first KPI** executives want to see.

## 📦 Step 2: Best-Selling Products

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_units_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_units_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 🔍 Insight:

* Identifies **top 10 products by volume**
* Helps inventory and marketing teams focus on best sellers.

---

## 🗂 Step 3: Revenue by Category

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS category_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY category_revenue DESC;
```

### 🔍 Insight:

* Shows which product categories generate the most money.
* Management can invest more in **high-performing categories**.

---

## 🌍 Step 4: Sales Performance by Region

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    region,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS regional_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY regional_revenue DESC;
```

### 🔍 Insight:

* Identifies strong and weak regions.
* Helps decide where to:

  * Increase marketing
  * Open new stores
  * Improve logistics

---

## 📅 Step 5: Monthly Sales Trend

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS monthly_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

### 🔍 Insight:

* Shows growth, decline, or seasonality.
* Helps forecasting and planning future campaigns.

---

## 👤 Step 6: Top Customers by Revenue

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS customer_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 🔍 Insight:

* Identifies **high-value customers**
* Important for loyalty programs and personalized offers.

## 📊 Step 7: Business Insights Summary

Based on the analysis, you might conclude:

* 20% of products generate 60% of revenue
* One region underperforms compared to others
* Sales peak during specific months
* A small group of customers contributes a large share of revenue

These insights help leaders **make data-driven decisions**.
