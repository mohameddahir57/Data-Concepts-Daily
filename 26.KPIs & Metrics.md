
# Day 26 → KPIs & Metrics (How to Measure What Matters)

In the data world, **numbers alone don’t matter**.
What matters is **which numbers you choose to track**.

That’s where **Metrics** and **KPIs** come in.

Companies use KPIs and metrics to understand performance, detect problems early, and make better decisions.

##  What Is a Metric?

A **metric** is **any measurable value** that tracks an activity or process.

Examples of metrics:

* Total sales
* Number of users
* Website visits
* Number of orders
* Response time
* Customer complaints

Metrics describe **what is happening**, but they don’t always tell you **if things are good or bad**.


##  What Is a KPI?

A **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)** is a **very important metric** tied directly to a **business goal**.

 All KPIs are metrics
 But **not all metrics are KPIs**

KPIs answer questions like:

* Are we growing?
* Are we profitable?
* Are we meeting our goals?
* Are we improving or declining?



##  Difference Between Metrics and KPIs

| Metric                  | KPI                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Tracks activity         | Tracks success           |
| Can be many             | Very few                 |
| Informational           | Decision-focused         |
| Example: website visits | Example: conversion rate |

A company might track **100 metrics**, but only **10 KPIs**.


##  Why KPIs Are Critical in Data Analytics

KPIs help:

* Managers make decisions
* Teams focus on what matters
* Analysts measure impact

Without KPIs, businesses operate **blindly**.

###  Characteristics of a Good KPI

* **Time-based**

This is often called **SMART KPIs**:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time-bound


###  Examples of Bad KPIs

* “More customers” (not measurable)
* “Improve quality” (too vague)
* “Increase engagement” (no definition)

KPIs must be **precise and measurable**.


##  KPIs in Dashboards

KPIs are usually:

* Shown at the **top of dashboards**
* Displayed as:

  * Cards
  * Gauges
  * Scorecards
* Compared against:

  * Targets
  * Previous periods
  * Benchmarks

Dashboards help leaders **see KPIs at a glance**.


##  Role of a Data Analyst in KPIs

As a data analyst, you will:

* Define KPIs with stakeholders
* Calculate KPIs accurately
* Validate data sources
* Build KPI dashboards
* Explain KPI changes
* Identify trends and risks

Analysts turn KPIs into **business stories**.


##  Real-World Example: E-Commerce Company

**Business goal:** Increase revenue

| KPI                 | Why It Matters              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Conversion rate     | Shows how many visitors buy |
| Average order value | Shows purchase size         |
| Customer retention  | Shows loyalty               |
| Churn rate          | Shows customer loss         |
| Revenue growth      | Shows overall success       |

Each KPI connects directly to a goal.


##  Common KPI Mistakes

* Tracking too many KPIs
* Using KPIs without business goals
* Not updating KPIs regularly
* Ignoring data quality
* Focusing on vanity metrics (likes, views only)

KPIs should **drive action**, not decoration.
