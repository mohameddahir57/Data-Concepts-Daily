# **Day 18 → Metadata (Data About Data)**

You already know what data is — numbers, text, dates, images, transactions, locations, and more.

But every piece of data also has **extra information** that helps us understand, organize, and manage it.
This extra information is called **metadata**.

Metadata is one of the most important concepts in data management, yet one of the simplest.

Let’s break it down.

## 🧩 **What Is Metadata? (Simple Definition)**

**Metadata = data about data.**

It tells you:

* What the data is
* When it was created
* Who created it
* What format it is
* How big it is
* How it should be used

Metadata makes data **easy to understand, search, organize, and trust**.


## 📦 **Everyday Examples of Metadata**

Here are simple real-life examples you already use:

### **📸 Example 1: Photo on your phone**

The image itself = data
Metadata includes:

* Date taken
* Time
* Camera model
* Location (GPS)
* File size
* Resolution

Without metadata, your phone couldn't organize photos by date or location.


### **🎵 Example 2: Music file**

Song file = data
Metadata includes:

* Artist name
* Album
* Genre
* Duration
* Year released

This is how Spotify organizes songs.


### **📄 Example 3: Excel/CSV file**

Sales data = data
Metadata includes:

* File name
* File size
* Number of columns
* Column descriptions
* When the file was updated

This helps analysts understand the dataset quickly.


## 🧠 **Why Metadata Is Important**

Metadata helps companies:

* Understand what their data means
* Avoid confusion
* Prevent errors
* Search for datasets easily
* Track data changes
* Improve data governance
* Keep data organized as the business grows

Good metadata = easier analysis, faster work, better decisions.


## 🧱 Types of Metadata

Metadata comes in different categories:


### **1️⃣ Descriptive Metadata**

Explains **what the data is**.

Examples:

* Title
* Author
* Description
* Tags
* Keywords

Used for searching and discovery.

---

### **2️⃣ Structural Metadata**

Explains **how the data is organized**.

Examples:

* Table relationships
* Columns and data types
* File structure (CSV, JSON, XML)
* Primary keys

Helps analysts understand the structure.


### **3️⃣ Administrative Metadata**

Explains **how the data is managed**.

Examples:

* Who created the data
* Who last updated it
* Access permissions
* File ownership
* Storage location

Very important for governance and IT teams.


## 🗃️ Metadata in Databases (Simple Example)

Imagine a database table called `Customers`.

The **data** is the rows:

```
Name | Age | Email
```

The **metadata** is:

* Column names
* Data types (text, number, date)
* Table size
* Last updated date
* Primary key (Customer_ID)

This helps analysts understand how to use the data correctly.


## 🔍 Metadata Helps with Data Discovery

Big companies have thousands of datasets. Metadata helps teams:

* Search datasets by keywords
* Understand what each dataset contains
* Know who to ask for more info
* Avoid using the wrong data

This is often managed using a **Data Catalog** (like Google Data Catalog, Alation, or Collibra).
