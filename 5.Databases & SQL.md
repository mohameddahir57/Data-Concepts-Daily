# Day 5 — Databases & SQL (Simple Explanations)

Today we learn two important ideas every data analyst must understand:

1. **What a database is**
2. **What SQL is and why we use it**

This lesson is beginner-friendly — no technical background needed.

# What Is a Database?

A **database** is a place where data is stored, organized, and managed.

Think of it like:

A digital filing cabinet.
A structured storage system.
Used by every company (banks, shops, apps, hospitals, schools).



## Why Databases Are Important

* Store large amounts of information
* Keep data organized
* Allow quick searching
* Help companies make decisions
* Protect data from being lost

Example database data:

* Users of an app
* Sales records of a supermarket
* Orders from an online shop
* Employee details in a company

Databases are everywhere.



# How Data Is Stored in a Database

Data is stored in **tables**, like Excel sheets.

Example table: **Customers**

| CustomerID | Name    | City    | Age |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| 1          | Ali     | Nairobi | 23  |
| 2          | Sarah   | Lagos   | 29  |
| 3          | Mohamed | Cairo   | 31  |

A database can have many tables:

* Customers
* Orders
* Products
* Payments

This structure helps keep data clean and organized.



# What Is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a language used to communicate with databases.

SQL allows you to:

* Get data
* Filter data
* Sort data
* Join tables
* Clean data
* Create new tables
* Update or delete records

  **Every data analyst uses SQL.**
It is one of the most important tools in data careers.



# Simple SQL Examples (Beginner-Friendly)

### **1. Select Data**

Show all customers:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```



### **2. Select Specific Columns**

Show only names and cities:

```sql
SELECT Name, City FROM Customers;
```



### **3. Filter Data**

Show customers older than 25:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Customers
WHERE Age > 25;
```



### **4. Sort Data**

Sort customers from youngest to oldest:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Customers
ORDER BY Age ASC;
```

---

### **5. Count Records**

Count how many customers exist:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers;
```



# Real Example: Supermarket Database

A supermarket might use SQL to answer:

* Which product sells the most?
* What is the total sales this month?
* Which branch performed best?
* Who are the top 5 customers?

SQL retrieves these answers quickly and accurately.



# Where SQL Is Used

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQL Server
* Oracle
* Google BigQuery
* Snowflake
* Amazon Redshift

Companies rely on SQL every day.



# Summary

| Concept  | Meaning                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Database | Structured place where data is stored |
| Table    | Like an Excel sheet inside a database |
| SQL      | Language to interact with databases   |
| SELECT   | Retrieve data                         |
| WHERE    | Filter data                           |
| ORDER BY | Sort data                             |

SQL is simple to start and very powerful as you grow.
