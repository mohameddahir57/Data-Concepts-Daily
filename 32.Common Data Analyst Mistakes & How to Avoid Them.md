##  Mistake 1: Not Understanding the Business Question

### What goes wrong

Many beginners jump straight into:

* Cleaning data
* Writing SQL queries
* Building dashboards

Without clearly understanding **what problem they are solving**.

### Why this is a problem

You may produce:

* The wrong metrics
* Useless dashboards
* Insights nobody asked for

###  How to avoid it

Always ask:

* What decision will be made using this data?
* Who is the stakeholder?
* What question are we answering?

**Rule:**
  *No business question = no analysis*

##  Mistake 2: Trusting the Data Without Checking Quality

### What goes wrong

Assuming the data is:

* Accurate
* Complete
* Clean

When it’s not.

### Common data quality issues

* Missing values
* Duplicates
* Wrong data types
* Outdated records
* Inconsistent categories

###  How to avoid it

Always perform **data quality checks**:

* Check for nulls
* Check duplicates
* Validate ranges
* Compare totals with known sources

**Rule:**
  *Bad data = bad insights*

##  Mistake 3: Overcomplicating the Analysis

### What goes wrong

Using:

* Complex SQL queries
* Advanced Python code
* Fancy charts

When simple analysis would work better.

### Why this is bad

* Stakeholders get confused
* Insights are unclear
* Maintenance becomes difficult

###  How to avoid it

Start simple:

* Simple metrics first
* Simple charts first
* Add complexity only if needed

**Rule:**
  *Clarity beats complexity*

##  Mistake 4: Choosing the Wrong Visualization

### What goes wrong

Using:

* Pie charts with too many slices
* 3D charts
* Too many colors
* Too many charts on one dashboard

### Why this is bad

* Viewers can’t understand the message
* Important insights get lost

###  How to avoid it

Use:

* Bar charts for comparison
* Line charts for trends
* Tables for exact values

Keep dashboards:

* Clean
* Focused
* Simple

**Rule:**
  *The chart should answer one question clearly*

##  Mistake 5: Ignoring Context

### What goes wrong

Reporting numbers without explanation.

Example:

> “Sales dropped by 15%”

But **why**?

### Why this is a problem

Numbers without context:

* Can be misunderstood
* Can cause wrong decisions

###  How to avoid it

Always add:

* Time context (month, year, season)
* Business context (campaigns, events)
* Comparisons (previous period, target)

**Rule:**
 *Explain the story behind the number*



##  Mistake 6: Confusing Correlation with Causation

### What goes wrong

Assuming:

> “Because A happened, B caused it”

Example:

* Ice cream sales increase
* Crime increases
* Ice cream does NOT cause crime

### Why this is dangerous

* Leads to wrong conclusions
* Leads to bad business decisions

###  How to avoid it

Be careful with claims:

* Say “related to” instead of “caused by”
* Use experiments (A/B testing) when possible

**Rule:**
  *Correlation ≠ causation*



##  Mistake 7: Not Documenting Work

### What goes wrong

* No comments in SQL
* No explanation of logic
* No README files

### Why this matters

* Others can’t understand your work
* You forget what you did
* Hard to maintain projects

###  How to avoid it

Always:

* Comment your queries
* Explain metrics
* Write README files
* Add notes in dashboards

**Rule:**
  *Your future self is also a user*

##  Mistake 8: Focusing Only on Tools, Not Thinking

### What goes wrong

Thinking:

* “If I learn Python, I’m an analyst”
* “If I know Power BI, I’m done”

### Why this is wrong

Tools change.
**Thinking skills stay.**

###  How to avoid it

Focus on:

* Analytical thinking
* Problem-solving
* Business understanding
* Communication

Tools are just helpers.

**Rule:**
  *Thinking > tools*

##  Mistake 9: Poor Communication of Insights

### What goes wrong

* Using technical language with non-technical people
* Sharing raw numbers without explanation

### Why this fails

Stakeholders don’t care about:

* SQL queries
* Code
  They care about **decisions**.

###  How to avoid it

Translate insights into:

* Simple language
* Clear recommendations
* Business impact

**Rule:**
 *If they don’t understand it, it doesn’t matter*

##  Mistake 10: Not Validating Results

### What goes wrong

Publishing results without double-checking.

### Risks

* Wrong dashboards
* Wrong KPIs
* Loss of trust

###  How to avoid it

Always:

* Re-check calculations
* Compare totals
* Ask a teammate to review

**Rule:**
  *Measure twice, publish once*
