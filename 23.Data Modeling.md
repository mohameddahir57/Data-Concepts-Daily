# **Day 23 → Data Modeling (Facts & Dimensions)**

Data modeling is how we **organize data so it makes sense for analysis**.
Raw data by itself is confusing. Data modeling gives it **structure, clarity, and meaning**.

Without data modeling:

* Dashboards are slow
* Reports are confusing
* Numbers don’t match
* Business teams lose trust

With good data modeling:

* Analysis is fast
* Metrics are clear
* Dashboards are reliable


##  **What Is Data Modeling?**

**Data modeling** is the process of designing how data is:

* Stored
* Organized
* Related
* Used for analysis

In analytics and BI, data modeling focuses on **business questions**, not just storage.

Example business questions:

* How much did we sell?
* By which product?
* In which country?
* During which month?

To answer these efficiently, we use **Facts** and **Dimensions**.


##  **Facts & Dimensions (The Core Idea)**

Most analytical databases are built using:

* **Fact tables**
* **Dimension tables**

Together, they form the foundation of **analytical models**.


## 📦 **Fact Tables**

### 🔹 What Is a Fact Table?

A **fact table** stores **measurable, numeric values**.

Facts answer the question:

> **“How much?” or “How many?”**


### 🔢 Examples of Facts

* Sales amount
* Quantity sold
* Revenue
* Profit
* Number of orders
* Number of clicks
* Distance traveled

Facts are usually:

* Numeric
* Aggregated (sum, average, count)
* Business metrics


### 🧾 Example: Sales Fact Table

| order_id | product_id | customer_id | date_id | quantity | sales_amount |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 1001     | P01        | C01         | D01     | 2        | 40           |
| 1002     | P02        | C02         | D01     | 1        | 25           |

This table answers:

* How much was sold?
* How many items?
* How many orders?


## 🧭 **Dimension Tables**

### 🔹 What Is a Dimension Table?

A **dimension table** stores **descriptive information**.

Dimensions answer questions like:

> **“Who?” “What?” “Where?” “When?” “How?”**


### 🏷 Examples of Dimensions

* Customer details
* Product details
* Time (date, month, year)
* Location (city, country)
* Store
* Category

Dimensions provide **context** to facts.


### 🧾 Example: Product Dimension

| product_id | product_name | category | brand  |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------- | ------ |
| P01        | T-Shirt      | Clothing | Nike   |
| P02        | Shoes        | Footwear | Adidas |

This allows analysis like:

* Sales by category
* Sales by brand


### 🧾 Example: Date Dimension

| date_id | date       | month   | quarter | year |
| ------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- | ---- |
| D01     | 2025-01-01 | January | Q1      | 2025 |

This allows:

* Sales by month
* Sales by year
* Trend analysis


## 🔗 **How Facts & Dimensions Work Together**

Fact tables **connect** to dimension tables using **keys**.

Example:

* `product_id` connects fact table → product dimension
* `customer_id` connects fact table → customer dimension

This creates a **model** that supports flexible analysis.


## 📊 **Why Facts & Dimensions Are Important**

They allow:

* Fast queries
* Simple dashboards
* Accurate metrics
* Easy filtering

Example dashboard filters:

* Sales by **country**
* Revenue by **product**
* Orders by **month**

All powered by facts + dimensions.


## 🏢 **Real-World Example (Retail Store)**

### Fact Table

* Sales Amount
* Quantity
* Discount

### Dimension Tables

* Customer (age, gender)
* Product (category, brand)
* Store (city, region)
* Date (day, month, year)

This lets the business answer:

* Which product sells best?
* Which city generates most revenue?
* Which month had highest sales?
* Which customer group buys more?


## ⚠️ Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Mixing facts and dimensions in one table
❌ Storing text in fact tables
❌ No date dimension
❌ Poor naming of columns
❌ Duplicating dimension data

Good modeling avoids these mistakes.


## 🎯 **Why Data Analysts Must Understand This**

Even if you don’t build databases:

* You read data models
* You build dashboards on top of them
* You write SQL queries using them
* You explain metrics to stakeholders

Data modeling is **thinking like the business**.


## 🧩 **Simple Rule to Remember**

* **Facts = Numbers you measure**
* **Dimensions = Descriptions that explain the numbers**

If you remember this, data modeling becomes easy.


## 🧾 **Summary Table**

| Concept         | Meaning                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Data Modeling   | Organizing data for analysis |
| Fact Table      | Stores numeric metrics       |
| Dimension Table | Stores descriptive details   |
| Keys            | Connect facts to dimensions  |
