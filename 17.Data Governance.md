# **Day 17 → Data Governance (How Companies Manage Data)**

As companies grow, they collect huge amounts of data — customer information, sales, marketing, finance, product usage, and more.
But having data is not enough.
Companies must **manage**, **protect**, and **control** that data properly.

This is where **Data Governance** comes in.

Data Governance is like the **rulebook** for how a company uses data.

## 🏛️ **What Is Data Governance? (Simple Definition)**

**Data Governance** is the set of rules, processes, and responsibilities that make sure data is:

* Reliable
* Secure
* High-quality
* Well-organized
* Used correctly
* Available to the right people
* Protected from the wrong people

Think of it like the “traffic laws” of data inside a company.

## ⚙️ Why Companies Need Data Governance

Without governance, data becomes:

* Messy
* Inconsistent
* Unsafe
* Hard to find
* Hard to trust

With strong governance, companies get:

* Better decision-making
* Clear data ownership
* Strong data protection
* Higher data quality
* Less risk of mistakes and leaks

They decide what the data should be used for.

### **2️⃣ Data Stewards**

They maintain data quality and ensure rules are followed.

### **3️⃣ Data Engineers**

They build systems to store and move data safely.

### **4️⃣ Data Analysts**

They use governed data for reporting and insights.

## 🧩 The Main Components of Data Governance

### **1. Data Policies (The rules)**

These are official guidelines like:

* How long data can be stored
* Who can access customer data
* Which tools can be used
* How data must be protected

---

### **2. Data Standards (The format)**

Data should follow the same structure everywhere.

Examples:

* Dates are always YYYY-MM-DD
* Phone numbers have the same format
* Names are written consistently

---

### **3. Data Quality Management**

Processes to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency (what you learned in Day 16).

---

### **4. Access Control**

Not everyone should see everything.

Examples:

* Analysts can see sales data
* Only HR can see employee salaries
* Only managers can access sensitive reports

This protects people’s privacy.

---

### **5. Data Security**

Tools and techniques to prevent:

* Hacks
* Leaks
* Unauthorized access
* Data loss

Security is a big part of governance.
