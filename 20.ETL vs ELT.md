# **📅 Day 20 — ETL vs ELT (Data Processing Methods)**

### *How data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared before analysts use it.*

When companies collect data, it’s almost never clean or ready for analysis.
That’s why they use **ETL** or **ELT**, two different ways to process and prepare the data.

Let’s break it down in a simple, beginner-friendly style.

---

# **🔌 1. What Are ETL and ELT?**

Both are processes used to **move data** from one place (like an app or database) into a system (like a data warehouse or data lake).
The difference lies in the *order* of the steps.

---

# **🔹 ETL = Extract → Transform → Load**

**ETL** is the traditional method, used for many years by companies.

### **1️⃣ Extract**

Take data from different sources:

* Databases
* Websites
* Apps
* Excel files
* APIs

### **2️⃣ Transform**

Clean and prepare the data *before* storing it:

* Remove duplicates
* Fix missing values
* Convert dates
* Filter columns
* Standardize formats

### **3️⃣ Load**

Put the clean data into a **data warehouse**.

---

## ✔ When ETL Is Used

* When data must be **high-quality before storage**
* When companies use **data warehouses** (like Oracle, Snowflake, BigQuery)
* When the data volume is medium-sized
* When accuracy and consistency are more important than speed

**Example:**
A bank cleaning transaction data *before* inserting it into the warehouse.

# **🔹 ELT = Extract → Load → Transform**

This is the **modern** method used by big tech companies.

### **1️⃣ Extract**

Take data from the sources.

### **2️⃣ Load**

Put the raw data **directly into a data lake or cloud warehouse**.
No cleaning yet.

### **3️⃣ Transform**

Clean and prepare later, using cloud computing power.

---

## ✔ When ELT Is Used

* When data volumes are **huge** (TBs of raw logs, streaming data)
* When using **data lakes** (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake)
* When doing machine learning
* When companies want data stored *immediately*, without delay

**Example:**
Netflix loading millions of viewing logs every second directly into their data lake, then transforming later.

# **📊 2. ETL vs ELT — Simple Comparison Table**

| Feature                     | ETL                        | ELT                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Where cleaning happens?** | Before loading             | After loading               |
| **Storage target**          | Data Warehouse             | Data Lake / Cloud Warehouse |
| **Data type**               | Mostly structured          | Structured + unstructured   |
| **Speed**                   | Slower (clean first)       | Faster (load first)         |
| **Best for**                | Clean dashboards & reports | Big data, ML                |
| **Cost**                    | More expensive             | Usually cheaper             |

# **🧠 3. Easy Real-Life Analogy**

### **ETL = Clean your clothes before putting them in your closet.**

* You wash, dry, and fold everything
* Then you place clean clothes in the closet

### **ELT = Put all clothes in a big laundry basket first, wash later.**

* You throw everything in a giant basket (the data lake)
* Later, you choose what to clean + how

---

# **🔧 4. Why Does This Matter for Data Analysts?**

Because you will often work with:

### **➡ Clean, transformed data = from ETL pipelines**

This is what you use for:

* Power BI dashboards
* Excel analysis
* SQL reporting

### **➡ Raw data = from ELT pipelines**

This is what you use for:

* Python cleaning
* Pandas transformations
* Machine learning workflows

Understanding ETL vs ELT helps you know **how and why your data arrives in the format you see**.

# **🎯 5. Which One Do Modern Companies Use?**

Many companies now use **both**:

* **ETL** for reporting/finance data
* **ELT** for big data + ML
* Some adopt “**Lakehouse**” systems that support both styles

---

# **⚡ Summary (Very Short)**

* **ETL:** Clean first → store later. For warehouses.
* **ELT:** Store raw data first → clean later. For lakes + cloud.
* ETL = traditional, ELT = modern big-data style.
