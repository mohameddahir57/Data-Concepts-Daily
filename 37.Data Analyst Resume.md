# **Day 37 → How to Write a Strong Data Analyst Resume**

Your resume is often the **first and only chance** you get to impress a recruiter.
Before interviews, before tests, before GitHub — your resume decides **whether you get noticed or ignored**.

Today we break down **how to write a strong data analyst resume**, even if you are a **beginner or self-taught**.

##  What Is the Purpose of a Data Analyst Resume?

A data analyst resume must answer **three questions** clearly:

1. **Can you analyze data?**
2. **Can you use the right tools?**
3. **Can you create business impact with data?**

Recruiters don’t care about long stories — they care about **skills, projects, and results**.

##  Key Sections of a Strong Data Analyst Resume

A good resume has **clear structure**. These are the essential sections:

1. Header (Name & Contact)
2. Professional Summary
3. Skills
4. Projects
5. Experience (if any)
6. Education
7. Certifications (optional)

Let’s break each one down.

## 1️. Header (Simple & Professional)

Include only what matters:

* Full name
* Email (professional)
* LinkedIn
* GitHub
* Location (City/Country – optional)

  **Good example:**

```
Mohamed Dahir Osman  
Aspiring Data Analyst  
Email: mohamed@email.com  
GitHub: github.com/username  
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/username
```

  Avoid:

* Emojis
* Personal photos
* Too many links
* Nicknames


## 2️. Professional Summary (Very Important)

This is a **2–3 line introduction** at the top.

It should say:

* Who you are
* What tools you use
* What kind of role you want

  **Beginner-friendly example:**

```
Aspiring Data Analyst with hands-on experience in Excel, SQL, and Python.
Skilled in data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.
Passionate about turning raw data into clear business insights.
```

  Avoid:

* Long paragraphs
* Vague phrases like “hard-working”
* Copy-paste summaries

## 3️. Skills Section (Be Honest & Clear)

Split skills into categories:

###  Data Analysis

* Data cleaning
* Data analysis
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Data visualization

###  Tools

* Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, Charts)
* SQL (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY)
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
* Power BI / Tableau

###  Other

* Git & GitHub
* Basic statistics

  Only list skills you **actually used**.

## 4️. Projects (MOST IMPORTANT FOR BEGINNERS)

If you don’t have job experience, **projects are your experience**.

Each project should include:

* Project name
* Tools used
* What you did
* What insight you found

###  Example Project Entry:

```

Tools: Excel, SQL  

• Cleaned and prepared raw sales data (missing values, duplicates)  
• Analyzed monthly sales trends using SQL queries  
• Identified top-performing products and regions

```

 This is where your **GitHub repositories** shine.

## 5️. Experience Section (If You Have It)

If you have work experience (even non-data):

Focus on **data-related tasks**.

  Example:

```
Operations Assistant  
• Tracked daily performance metrics using Excel  
• Created simple reports for management  
• Improved reporting accuracy by organizing data
```

If you have no experience — **it’s OK**. Projects are enough.

## 6️. Education (Simple & Clean)

Include:

* Degree or program
* Institution
* Year

Example:

```

* Google Data Analytics
* IBM Data Analyst

  1 page only (for beginners)
